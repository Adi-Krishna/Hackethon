<center><h2> 10 Important Tips To Gain Weight </h2></center>

<center><i>Combining a high calorie intake with heavy strength training are the two most important factors.That being said, there are several other strategies to gain weight even faster.<br>

Here are 10 most important tips to gain weight:-</center></i>
<br><br>
<li>Don’t drink water before meals. This can fill your stomach and make it harder to get in enough calories.</li>
<li>Eat more often. Squeeze in an additional meal or snack whenever you can, such as before bed.</li>
<li>Drink milk. Drinking whole milk to quench thirst is a simple way to get in more high-quality protein and calories.</li>
<li>Try weight gainer shakes. If you’re really struggling then you can try weight gainer shakes. These are very high in protein, carbs and calories.</li>
<li>Use bigger plates. Definitely use large plates if you’re trying to get in more calories, as smaller plates cause people to automatically eat less.</li>
<li>Add cream to your coffee. This is a simple way to add in more calories.</li>
<li>Take creatine. The muscle building supplement creatine monohydrate can help you gain a few pounds in muscle weight.</li>
<li>Get quality sleep. Sleeping properly is very important for muscle growth.</li>
<li>Eat your protein first and vegetables last. If you have a mix of foods on your plate, eat the calorie-dense and protein-rich foods first. Eat the vegetables last.</li>
<li>Don’t smoke. Smokers tend to weigh less than non-smokers, and quitting smoking often leads to weight gain.</li>

<center><h2> Eat Plenty Of Protein </h2>

<p><i>The single most important nutrient for gaining healthy weight is protein</i><br><br>
Muscle is made of protein and without it most of those extra calories may end up as body fat.
Studies show that during periods of overfeeding, a high-protein diet causes many of the extra calories to be turned into muscle (12Trusted Source).
However, keep in mind that protein is a double-edged sword. It’s also highly filling, which may reduce your hunger and appetite significantly, making it harder to get in enough calories.<br><br>
If you’re trying to gain weight, aim for 0.7–1 grams of protein per pound of body weight (1.5–2.2 grams of protein per kilogram). You can even go above that if your calorie intake is very high.
High-protein foods include meats, fish, eggs, many dairy products, legumes, nuts and others. Protein supplements like whey protein can also be useful if you struggle to get enough protein in your diet.</p>
