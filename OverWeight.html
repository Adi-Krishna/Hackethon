<center><h2><b> Diet </b></h2></center>
<p><i><center>There's no single rule that applies to everyone, but to lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 0.5 to 1kg a week, most people are advised to reduce their energy intake by 600 calories a day.
For most men, this will mean consuming no more than 1,900 calories a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400 calories a day.
The best way to achieve this is to swap unhealthy and high-energy food choices – such as fast food, processed food and sugary drinks (including alcohol) – for healthier choices.
</center></i></p>

A healthy diet should consist of:

<li>Plenty of fruit and vegetables</li>
<li>Plenty of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy foods (ideally you should choose wholegrain varieties)</li>
<li>Some milk and dairy foods</li>
<li>Some meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein</li>
<li>Just small amounts of food and drinks that are high in fat and sugar</li>
<li>Try to avoid foods containing high levels of salt because they can raise your blood pressure, which can be dangerous for people who are already obese. Read some tips for a lower-salt diet.</li>

<p><i><center>You'll also need to check calorie information for each type of food and drink you consume to make sure you don't go over your daily limit.
Some restaurants, cafés and fast food outlets provide calorie information per portion, although providing this information isn't compulsory. Be careful when eating out because some foods can quickly take you over the limit, such as burgers, fried chicken, and some curries or Chinese dishes.</center></i></p>

<center><h2><b> Diet Programmes and Fad Diets </b></h2></center>

<p><i><center>Avoid fad diets that recommend unsafe practices, such as fasting (going without food for long periods of time) or cutting out entire food groups. These types of diets do not work, can make you feel ill, and are not sustainable because they do not teach you long-term healthy eating habits.
This is not to say that all commercial diet programmes are unsafe. Many are based on sound medical and scientific principles and can work well for some people.
A responsible diet programme should:</center></i></p>

<li>Educate you about issues such as portion size, making behavioural changes and healthy eating</li>
<li>Not be overly restrictive in terms of the type of foods you can eat </li>
<li>Be based on achieving gradual, sustainable weight loss rather than short-term rapid weight loss, which is unlikely to last</li>

<center><h2><b> Other Useful Strategies </b></h2></center>

<center><i>Evidence has shown that weight loss can be more successful if it involves other strategies, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. This could include things like:</i></center>
<br><br>
<li>setting realistic weight loss goals – if you're obese, losing just 3% of your original body weight can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications</li>
<li>eating more slowly and being mindful of what and when you're eating – for example, not being distracted by watching TV</li>
<li>avoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to overeat</li>
<li>involving your family and friends with your weight loss efforts – they can help to motivate you</li>
<li>monitoring your progress – for example, weigh yourself regularly and make a note of your weight in a diary</li>
